2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
IOSTDTYPE-1#1 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port MCK_N is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of LVDS_25 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

IOSTDTYPE-1#2 Critical Warning
IOStandard Type  
I/O port MCK_P is Single-Ended but has an IOStandard of LVDS_25 which can only support Differential
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
2 out of 138 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: DSYNC, DTX.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
3 out of 138 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: DSYNC, DTX, MCK_N.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port SPI_D expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-181#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (design_2_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
